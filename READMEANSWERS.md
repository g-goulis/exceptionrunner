1.) The logger can be configured to write to a file as well as the console.
    Other configurations can be made such as the Level the logging occurs at
    such as the INFO level or the WARNING level allowing for more granularity.
2.) The Timer fail test
3.) It asserts that the anonymous function of parameter 2 throws an exception
    of the type specified in the parameter 1.
4.)
    I) The serialVersionUID is used to serialize and deserialize the object
    II) We need to override the constructors because if you override 1 then 
        the default constructor will no longer exists.
    III) We need to override the constructors because if you override 1 then
        the default constructor will no longer exists.
5.) The static block is run once whenever an object is instantiated.
6.) The format is in Markdown, it is related to Bitbucket because Bitbucket
    show the markdown file if it is located in your repository.
7.) Timer needed to be intitialized before the try statement, the problem
    was it was being used while null because an exception was thrown.
8.) It goes try, then catch, then finally but if an exception is thrown you
    immediately move to the catch and stop the rest of the try. Finally is 
    always run.

10.)
11.) The timer is an InterruptedException, nullpointerexception is when you 
     try to use null where a value shouldnt be null like a calculation
     or calling a function on a null object.
